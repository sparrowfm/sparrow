                <h2>About This Blog</h2>
                <p>I'm a business and product executive with zero coding experience. After years of working with engineering teams at <a href="https://www.amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250101000000/wondery.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wondery</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101000000/fox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120101000000/rovicorp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rovi</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060101000000/tvguide.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV Guide</a>, I decided to build my own projects using AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor).</p>
                <p>This blog documents the journey—technical deep-dives on what actually works in production, AI prompting strategies, architecture decisions, and lessons learned the hard way.</p>
                <p>If you're a founder without a technical co-founder, a PM learning to code, or a developer exploring AI-assisted development, welcome. I'm learning in public, and I hope these posts help you ship faster.</p>
